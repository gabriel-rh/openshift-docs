The `odo logs` command can be used with the following flags:

* `odo logs --dev`, to see the logs for the containers created by the `odo dev` command.
* `odo logs --deploy`, to see the logs for the containers created by the `odo deploy` command.
* `odo logs`, without any flag, to see the logs of all the containers created by both `odo dev` and `odo deploy`.

If multiple containers have the same name, for example, `main`, the `odo logs` output appends a number to 
container name to help differentiate the containers. In the output, you will see containers named as `main`, 
`main[1]`, `main[2]` and so on.

The command also supports the `--follow` flag which allows you to follow or tail or stream the logs for the containers. Use the same commands as before, with a `--follow` flag:

* `odo logs --dev --follow`, to follow the logs for the containers created by `odo dev` command.
* `odo logs --deploy --follow`, to follow the logs for the containers created by `odo deploy` command.
* `odo logs --follow`, without `--dev` or `--deploy`, to follow the logs of all the containers created by both `odo dev` and `odo deploy`.
