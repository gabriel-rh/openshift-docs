Learn how to use `odo` to create a "Hello World" application based on one of the following frameworks:

* Node.js
* Java (Spring Boot)
* .NET
* Go

== Prerequisites

* You have the xref:../installing-odo.adoc#installing-odo[odo binary] installed.
* You have access to an {product-title} cluster.

== Generating sample code

This tutorial uses a sample project for each framework, but you can choose other examples from the list provided by the `odo registry` command. You can also use an existing project or run `odo init` and select a starter project.

== Initializing your application (odo init)

After generating sample code, initialize your application by creating a `devfile.yaml` that you will subsequently deploy. 

`odo` handles this automatically with the `odo init` command, by auto-detecting your source code and downloading the appropriate Devfile.

== Developing your application

`odo` uses _inner loop_ development and allows you to code, build, run, and test the application in a continuous workflow. After you run `odo dev`, you can freely edit code in your favourite IDE and watch as `odo` rebuilds and redeploys it.

== Optional: Deleting the resources

After testing your application, you may optionally remove the resources by using the `odo delete component` command.
