= odo remove binding

The `odo remove binding` command removes the link created between the component and a service through a service binding.

Running this command removes the reference from the devfile, but does not necessarily remove it from the cluster. To remove the ServiceBinding resource from the cluster, you must run `odo dev`, or `odo deploy`.

The command takes a required `--name` flag that points to the name of the service binding to be removed.

.Sample command
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo remove binding --name <ServiceBinding_name>
----

.Sample output
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo remove binding --name redis-service-my-nodejs-app
 âœ“  Successfully removed the binding from the devfile. You can now run `odo dev` or `odo deploy` to delete it from the cluster.
