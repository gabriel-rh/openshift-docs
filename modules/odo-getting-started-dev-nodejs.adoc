= Developing your Node.js application

`odo` uses inner loop development and allows you to code, build, run, and test the application in a continuous workflow. After you run `odo dev`, you can freely edit code in your favourite IDE and watch as `odo` rebuilds and redeploys it.

Use the `odo dev` command to start developing your application.

.Prerequisites
* You have sample code for a Node.js application.
* You have logged in to your {product-title} cluster and created a project.
* You have initialized your application with `odo init`.

.Procedure
* Run the command `odo dev`:

↪ Deploying to the cluster in developer mode
 ✓  Waiting for Kubernetes resources [3s]
 ✓  Syncing files into the container [330ms]
 ✓  Building your application in container on cluster [4s]
 ✓  Executing the application [1s]

Your application is now running on the cluster
 - Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 3000

Watching for changes in the current directory /Users/user/express
Press Ctrl+c to exit `odo dev` and delete resources from the cluster
