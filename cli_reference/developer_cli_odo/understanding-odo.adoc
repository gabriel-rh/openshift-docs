Red Hat OpenShift Developer CLI (`odo`) is a tool for creating applications on {product-title} and Kubernetes. With `{odo-title}`, you can develop, test, debug, and deploy microservices-based applications on a Kubernetes cluster without having a deep understanding of the platform. `odo` abstracts the complex concepts of Kubernetes to help you focus on developing code. 

== Inner loop and outer loop

`odo` focuses on _inner loop_ development, and provides tools that help you make the transition to the _outer loop_.

Inner loop:: Consists of local coding, building, running, and testing the application. These are the activities performed by an individual developer.

Outer loop:: Consists of code reviews, integration tests, and security and compliance. These are the processes used by the larger development team to eventually deploy your code to the cluster. 

The inner loop primarily takes place on your development computer whereas the outer loop typically runs on shared servers, and is often automated with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

== Benefits of odo

As an application developer wanting to deploy to Kubernetes, `odo` helps if:

- You rely on frameworks such as Node.js, Java Spring Boot, and .NET.
- You want to run your application on Kubernetes-like infrastructure.
- You want to deploy to enterprise infrastructure even though you might not have a deep knowledge of Kubernetes and DevOps.

== Comparison with kubectl and oc

`odo` focuses on application developers and cloud engineers, whereas `kubectl` and `oc`, the command line interface for {product-title}, are DevOps tools. The latter help you to deploy applications to a cluster, and to support on-going maintenance, provided you already have a good knowledge of Kubernetes. `odo` does not support system administration or maintenance tasks for production clusters.
