[id="odo-push-watch-to-odo-dev_{context}"]

= odo push and odo watch replaced by odo dev

`odo` v3 replaces the commands `odo push` and `odo watch` from v2 with a single command `odo dev`. 

With `odo` v2, if you wanted to automatically synchronize the code running on the developer system with the application running on a Kubernetes cluster, you had to perform two steps:

. `odo push` to start the application on the cluster
. `odo watch` to automatically synchronize the code

To delete the inner loop resources of the component from the cluster, you had to use `odo delete` or`odo component delete`.

With `odo` v3, `odo dev` starts the application on the cluster and automatically synchronizes the code.
`odo dev` is a long-running process that blocks the terminal. When you enter `Ctrl+C`, `odo` v3 stops the process and automatically cleans up the component resources from the cluster.
