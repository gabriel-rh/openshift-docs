= Develop and deploy

The two most important commands in `odo` are `odo dev` and `odo deploy`. Learn when to use which command.

== odo dev

Use the `odo dev` command in the initial development phase of your application. For example, use `odo dev` when you are working with a local development environment and you are:

- Making changes regularly 
- Previewing changes
- Testing initial Kubernetes support for your application
- Debugging and running tests
- Deploying privately on a local development environment


== odo deploy

Use the `odo deploy` command in the deployment stage of development when you are ready for a "production ready" environment. For example, use `odo deploy` when you are working with a production environment and:

- You are ready to expose you application to other users.
- You need to build and push the container.
- You require custom Kubernetes YAML for your production environment.
