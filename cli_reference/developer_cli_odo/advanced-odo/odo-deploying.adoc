Use the `odo deploy` command to deploy your application. The deployment steps for each framework are similar: 

. Containerize your application by creating a Dockerfile.
. Modify your `devfile.yaml` to add your Kubernetes configuration.
. Run `odo deploy`.

`odo deploy` pushes your application image to a container register.

The details for the deployment procedure depend on the specific framework you are using.

.Prerequisites
* Log in to the container registry where you will push your application image, using `podman` or `docker`, for example:
+
.Sample command
[source, terminal]
----
$ podman login quay.io
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using macOS with Apple Silicon (M1 or M2), you must configure your Docker build platform for the cluster you are deploying to. For example, if you are deploying to `linux/amd64`:
```
$ export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64  
```
