[id="odo-getting-started-deploy-java_{context}"]

= Deploying your Java application

Use the `odo deploy` command to deploy your application.

.Prerequisites
* You have sample code for a Java application.
* You have logged in to your {product-title} cluster and created a project.
* You have initialized your application with `odo init`.
* You have started developing your application with `odo dev`.
* You have logged in to your image registry.
* You have configured the container build platform.

.Procedure
. *Containerize the application:* To deploy your application, you must containerize it to build and push it to a registry. Create the following Dockerfile in the same directory:
+
.Sample Dockerfile
[source, terminal]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11 as builder

USER jboss
WORKDIR /tmp/src
COPY --chown=jboss . /tmp/src
RUN mvn package

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11
COPY --from=builder /tmp/src/target/*.jar /deployments/app.jar
----

. *Modify the Devfile:* Edit the `devfile.yaml` and add the appropriate deployment code:
+
[WARNING]
====
When copying and pasting to `devfile.yaml`, verify that the lines you insert are correctly indented.
====
.. `odo deploy` uses Devfile schema 2.2.0. Change the schema to reflect the change:
+
[source, yaml]
----
# Deploy "kind" ID's use schema 2.2.0+
schemaVersion: 2.2.0
----

.. Add the variables section:
+
[source, yaml]
----
# Add the following variables code anywhere in devfile.yaml
# This MUST be a container registry you are able to access
variables:
  CONTAINER_IMAGE: quay.io/MYUSERNAME/java-springboot-odo-example
  RESOURCE_NAME: my-java-springboot-app
  CONTAINER_PORT: "8080"
  DOMAIN_NAME: java-springboot.example.com

Your Devfile has been successfully deployed
----
+
Use the `oc get routes` command to find the route URL. `odo` does not currently support retrieving the route.
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the image registry in the `devfile.yaml`, the access for the container image
pushed by `odo deploy` may be private by default. For example, for images pushed to link:https://quay.io[Quay.io], you might need to change the image visibility appropriately to run `odo deploy` successfully.
====
+
To test your application, visit the location from the `DOMAIN_NAME` variable in the `devfile.yaml`.
