= odo delete project

With the `odo delete project` command, you can delete a project on your {product-title} cluster.

.Sample command
[source,terminal]
----
odo delete project <name> [--wait] [--force]
----

.Sample output
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo delete project myproject
? Are you sure you want to delete project "myproject"? Yes
 âœ“  Project "myproject" deleted
----

You can use `namespace` as an alias for `project`. On an OpenShift cluster, you typically use `odo delete project` and that corresponds to the `odo delete namespace` command for Kubernetes clusters.

[TIP]
====
Using either of the aliases will not change the underlying resource deleted from the cluster. The command is smart enough to detect the resources supported by your cluster and to make an informed decision on the type of resource that should be deleted.

So you can run `odo delete project` on a Kubernetes cluster, and it will delete a `Namespace` resource, and you can run `odo create namespace` on an OpenShift cluster, it will create a `Project` resource.
