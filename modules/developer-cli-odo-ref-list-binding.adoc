= odo list binding

You can use the `odo list binding` command to list all the service bindings declared in the current namespace and also, if present, in the Devfile of the current directory.

This command supports the service bindings added with the command `odo add binding`, and bindings added manually to the Devfile, using a `ServiceBinding` resource from one of these `apiVersion`:

- `binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1`
- `servicebinding.io/v1alpha3`

The name of the service binding is prefixed with `*` when the service binding is declared in the Devfile present in the current directory.

To get more information about a specific service binding, you can run the command `odo describe binding --name <name>`.
