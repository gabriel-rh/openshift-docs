[id="odo-ingress-route-port-forwarding_{context}"]

= Ingress and Route replaced by port forwarding

With `odo` v2, you use `Route` resources on OpenShift, or `Ingress` resources on Kubernetes, to access applications that you push to the cluster with `odo push`. `odo` v3 uses port-forwarding.

When running `odo dev`, `odo` forwards a port on the development system to the port on the container cluster, allowing you remote access to your deployed application. It also displays the information when the application starts on the cluster:

[source,terminal]
----
$ odo dev
...
...
-  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 8080
----

The output indicates that `odo` is forwarding port `40001` on the development system to port `8080` of the application represented by the current `odo` component.

[NOTE]
====
`odo` v3 no longer creates `Ingress` or `Route` resources by default, and the `odo url` set of commands are not present in v3.
