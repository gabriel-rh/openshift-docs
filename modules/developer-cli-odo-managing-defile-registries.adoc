= Managing Devfile registries

`odo` uses the portable _Devfile_ format to describe the components. `odo` connects to various Devfile registries to download Devfiles for different languages and frameworks.

You can connect to publicly available Devfile registries, or you can install your own link:https://github.com/devfile/registry-support[Devfile Registry].

You can use the `odo preference <add/remove> registry` command to manage the registries used by `odo` to retrieve Devfile information.
