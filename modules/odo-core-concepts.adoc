= odo core concepts

`odo` abstracts Kubernetes concepts into terminology that is familiar to developers:

Application::
A typical application, developed using a link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps[cloud-native approach], that performs a particular task.
+
Examples of _applications_ include online video streaming, online shopping, and hotel reservation systems.

Component::
A set of Kubernetes resources that can run and be deployed separately. A cloud-native application is a collection of small, independent, loosely coupled _components_. `odo` uses Devfiles for the definition of _components_.
+
Examples of _components_ include an API back-end, a web interface, and a payment back-end.

Project::
A _project_ helps achieve multi-tenancy, so that different teams can deploy multiple applications on the cluster. In Kubernetes, a _project_ is represented by a `Namespace` resource, while in OpenShift it is a `Project` resource.

Context::
A directory that contains the source code, tests, libraries, and `odo` configuration files for a single _component_.

Devfile::
An open standard for defining containerized development environments. Devfiles are portable YAML files that contain the definition for a component and its parts. Devfiles enable developer tools to simplify and speed up workflows. For more information, see the documentation at link:https://devfile.io[].
