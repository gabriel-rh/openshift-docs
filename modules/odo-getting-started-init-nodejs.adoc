[id="odo-getting-started-init-nodejs_{context}"]

= Initializing your Node.js application (odo init)

Initialize your application by creating a `devfile.yaml` that you will deploy. `odo` handles this automatically with the `odo init` command by auto-detecting your source code and downloading the appropriate Devfile.

Run the `odo init` command and confirm that the `Project type` is correctly identified as `nodejs`.

.Prerequisites
* You have sample code for a Node.js application.
* You have logged in to your {product-title} cluster and created a project.

.Procedure
* Run the command `odo init`:
