== Bug fixes in odo version 3.0

* Before this update, `odo` did not honor directory entries in the `.gitignore` file, for example, `/target`. With this update, `odo` honors all `.gitignore` entries. 
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/4389[(odo-4389)]

* Before this update, port names did not match endpoint names. With this update, `odo` ensures that the names match.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/4737[(odo-4737)]

* Before this update, when running the `odo deploy` command, variables defined in a devfile would not be substituted in URI-referenced deployment manifest YAML files. With this update, `odo` performs the variable substitution correctly.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5451[(odo-5451)]

* Before this update, running the command `odo init --name <name> --devfile-path <path>` caused a panic to occur with a non-existent path. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5540[(odo-5540)]

* Before this update, `odo` commands ignored namespace settings in the `.odo/env/env.yaml` file. With this update, `odo` applies the namespace setting.

* Before this update, running the `odo dev` command could fail after you deployed a component with the `odo deploy` command. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5546[(odo-5546)]

* Before this update, the `odo dev` command did not use the `.gitignore` file when synchronizing files to a container. With this update, `odo` uses the `.gitignore` file.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5581[(odo-5581)]

* Before this update, the `odo deploy` and `odo build-images` commands did not work on Windows operating systems. With this update, `odo` can now build images on Windows.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5588[(odo-5588)]

* Before this update, the `odo delete` command failed for Kubernetes components. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5637[(odo-5637)]

* With this update, `odo` now supports the `command` field in container components.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5648[(odo-5648)]

* Before this update, when you stopped the `odo dev` process, resources created using `odo deploy` were removed. With this update, `odo` only deletes resources that were deployed using `odo dev`.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5700[(odo-5700)]

* Before this update, `odo` would display volumes defined in the devfile as containers. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5779[(odo-5779)]

* Before this update, `odo` would save the component name in the `env.yaml` file. With this update, the component name is only specified in the devfile.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5780[(odo-5780)]


* Before this update, after terminating the `odo dev` command, `odo` would delete the `ServiceBinding` resource but the logs would have an entry stating `Failed to delete the ServiceBinding resource`. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5797[(odo-5797)]

* Before this update, if you ran the `odo dev` command on a white background terminal, the colours could look wrong or the content could be hard to read. With this update, the content is displayed correctly.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5843[(odo-5843)]

* Before this update, the `odo logs` command could be slow to respond in certain environments. With this update, the command responds as expected.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5872[(odo-5872)]

* Before this update, the `odo dev port forward` command might timeout if the application is not ready. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5877[(odo-5877)]

* Before this update, the `odo dev` command would output the message `Executing the application`, after cleaning up the resources. With this update, the message is no longer output.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5881[(odo-5881)]

* Before this update, `odo` would not deploy `ServiceBinding` resources when you ran the `odo deploy` command. With this update, `ServiceBinding` resources are deployed correctly.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5883[(odo-5883)]

* Before this update, if the `Ephemeral` preference was set to `false`, the persistent volume claim (PVC) would not be owned by the `Deployment` resource. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5886[(odo-5886)]

* Before this update, `odo` would send telemetry data even if the `ODO_DEBUG_TELEMETRY_FILE` environment variable was set. With this update, `odo` saves all telemetry data to a file when the variable is set.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5937[(odo-5937)]

* Before this update, the output from some `odo` commands was inconsistent. This update fixes the issue.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5999[(odo-5999)]

* Before this update, when running the `odo list` command, non-`odo` components would not be reported. With this update, `odo` reports all components for `odo list`.
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/6007[(odo-6007)]

* Before this update, `odo` failed to execute the `run` command in the `java-quarkus` devfile. This update fixes the issue.
