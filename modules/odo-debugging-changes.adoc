= Changes to component debugging

With `odo` v2, you use the `odo push --debug` command to run a component in debug mode. To set up port forwarding to the component's debug port, you have to run `odo debug port-forward`.

In `odo` v3, you specify the debug port in the `devfile.yaml` as an endpoint, and run the `odo dev --debug` command to start the component in debug mode. The following example shows a `container` component in the Devfile, where port `3000` is the application port and `5858` is the debug port:
