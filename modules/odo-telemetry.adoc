= Telemetry in odo

If the user has consented to collecting usage data, `odo` collects the following data when a command is executed:

- Command name
- Command duration
- Command success
- Pseudonymized error message and error type, in the case of failure
- If the command is running from a terminal
- The version of `odo`


In addition, the following data about the user's identity is also collected:

- Operating system type
- Timezone
- Locale

The following table describes the additional information collected by `odo` commands:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===
|Command |Data
	
|`odo init`	|Component type, Devfile name, language, project type, interactive mode (boolean)
|`odo dev`	|Component type, Devfile name, language, project type
|`odo deploy`	|Component type, Devfile name, language, project type
|`odo <create/set/delete> namespace`	|Cluster type. Possible values are `OpenShift 3`, `OpenShift 4`, `Kubernetes`.
|===

All the data collected is pseudonymized to keep the user information anonymous.

[NOTE]
====
Telemetry data is not collected when you run `--help` for commands.

== Changing telemetry consent

You can change your telemetry consent by using the `odo preference` command:

* `odo preference set ConsentTelemetry true` consents to telemetry.
* `odo preference unset ConsentTelemetry` disables telemetry.
* `odo preference view` shows the current preferences.

You can also disable telemetry by setting the `ODO_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `true`. This environment variable overrides the ConsentTelemetry value set by `odo preference`.
