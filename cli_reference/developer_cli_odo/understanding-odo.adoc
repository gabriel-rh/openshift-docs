`{odo-title}` is a CLI tool for creating applications on {product-title} and Kubernetes. With `{odo-title}`, you can develop, test, debug and deploy microservices-based applications on a Kubernetes cluster without having a deep understanding of the platform.


`{odo-title}` follows a _create and push_ workflow. As a user, when you _create_, the information (or manifest) is stored in a configuration file. When you _push_, the corresponding resources are created on the Kubernetes cluster. All of this configuration is stored in the Kubernetes API for seamless accessibility and functionality.

`{odo-title}` uses _deploy and link_ commands to link components and services together. `{odo-title}` achieves this by creating and deploying services based on Kubernetes Operators in the cluster. Services can be created using any of the operators available on the Operator Hub. After linking a service, odo injects the service configuration into the service. Your application can then use this configuration to communicate with the Operator-backed service.



[id="odo-key-features"]
== Key features

`{odo-title}` is designed to be simple and easy to use, with the following functionality:

* Quickly deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster by creating a new manifest or using an existing one
* Use commands to easily create and update the manifest, without the need to understand and maintain Kubernetes configuration files
* Provide secure access to applications running on a Kubernetes cluster 
* Add and remove additional storage for applications on a Kubernetes cluster
* Create Operator-backed services and link your application to them
* Create a link between multiple microservices that are deployed as `odo` components
* Remotely debug applications you deployed using `odo` in your IDE
* Easily test applications deployed on Kubernetes using `odo`


== Core concepts

`{odo-title}` abstracts Kubernetes concepts into a developer friendly terminology:

Application::
An _application_ in `odo` is a classic application, developed with a link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps[cloud-native approach], that is used to perform a particular task.
+
Examples of applications: Online Video Streaming, Hotel Reservation System, Online Shopping.

Component::
A cloud-native application is a collection of small, independent, loosely coupled _components_. An `odo` component is a set of Kubernetes resources that  can run and be deployed separately.
+
Examples of components: API Backend, Web Frontend, Payment Backend.

Project::
A _project_ contains your source code, tests, and libraries, organized in a single unit. Projects helps achieve multi-tenancy, allowing multiple teams to run multiple applications at the same time, on a single cluster.


Context::
The _context_ is a directory that contains the source code, tests, libraries and `odo` specific config files for a single component.

URL::
A _URL_ exposes a component for access from outside the cluster.

Storage::
_Storage_ is the persistent storage in the cluster. It persists the data across restarts and across any rebuilds of a component.

Service::
A _service_ is an external application that provides additional functionality to a component.
+
Examples of services:  PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ.
+
In `{odo-title}`, services are provisioned from the OpenShift Service Catalog and must be enabled within your cluster.

[id="odo-listing-available-images"]
== Listing components

`odo` uses the portable _devfile_ format to describe components. It can connect to various devfile registries to download devfiles for different languages and frameworks. See the `odo registry` command for more information.

You can list all the _devfiles_ available of the different registries with the `odo catalog list components` command.

. Log in to the cluster with `{odo-title}`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
----

. List the available `{odo-title}` components:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo catalog list components
----
+
.Example output

[id="telemetry-in-odo"]
== Telemetry in odo

`{odo-title}` collects information about how `{odo-title}` is being  used, including metrics on operating system, RAM, CPU size, number of cores, version of `{odo-title}`, errors, success/failure, and time it takes for odo commands to complete.

You can modify your Telemetry consent by using the `odo preference` command:

* `odo preference set ConsentTelemetry true` consents to Telemetry.
* `odo preference unset ConsentTelemetry` disables Telemetry.
* `odo preference view` shows the current preferences.
