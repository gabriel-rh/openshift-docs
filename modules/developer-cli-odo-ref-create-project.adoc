= odo create project

With the `odo create project` command, you can create a project on your {product-title} cluster. Any newly-created project is set as the current active project. 

.Sample command
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo create project <name>
----

.Sample output
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo create project myproject
 ✓  Project "myproject" is ready for use
 ✓  New project created and now using project: myproject
----

You can use `namespace` as an alias for `project`. On an OpenShift cluster, you typically use `odo create project` and that corresponds to the `odo create namespace` command for Kubernetes clusters.

[TIP]
====
Using either of the aliases will not change to the underlying resource created on the cluster. The command is smart enough to detect the resources supported by your cluster and to make an informed decision on the type of resource that should be created.

So you can run `odo create project` on a Kubernetes cluster, and it will create a `Namespace` resource, and you can run `odo create namespace` on an OpenShift cluster, it will create a `Project` resource.
