The monitoring plugin in {coo-first} allows it to function in {rh-rhacm-first} environments, providing ACM with the same monitoring capabilities as {product-title}. You can configure the plugin to fetch alerts from ACM's own Alertmanager backend. This enables seamless integration and user experience by aligning ACM and OCP monitoring workflows.
