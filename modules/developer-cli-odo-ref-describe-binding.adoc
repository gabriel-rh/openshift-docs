= odo describe binding

The `odo describe binding` command provides information about service bindings. 

This command supports the service bindings added with the command `odo add binding` and also bindings added manually to the Devfile, using a `ServiceBinding` resource from one of these apiVersion:

- `binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1`
- `servicebinding.io/v1alpha3`

There are 2 ways to describe a service binding:

- Describe with access to Devfile
- Describe without access to Devfile

== Describe with access to Devfile

The `odo describe binding` command returns information extracted from the Devfile and, if possible, from the cluster.

The command lists the Kubernetes resources declared in the Devfile as a Kubernetes component,
with the kind `ServiceBinding` and one of these `apiVersion`:

- `binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1`
- `servicebinding.io/v1alpha3`

For each of these resources, the following information is displayed:

- The resource name.
- The list of the services to which the component is bound using this service binding.
- For each service listed, the namespace containing the service, if any. Otherwise, it indicates that the current namespace was used.
- Whether the variables are bound as files or as environment variables.
- The naming strategy used for binding names, if any.
- If the binding information is auto-detected.

.Sample output
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo describe binding
ServiceBinding used by the current component:

Service Binding Name: my-nodejs-app-cluster-sample
Services:
 •  cluster-sample (Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io) (namespace: shared-ns-1)
Bind as files: false
Detect binding resources: true
Naming strategy: uppercase
Available binding information: unknown

Service Binding Name: my-nodejs-app-redis-standalone
Services:
 •  redis-standalone (Redis.redis.redis.opstreelabs.in)
Bind as files: false
Detect binding resources: true
Available binding information: unknown

Binding information for one or more ServiceBinding is not available because they don't exist on the cluster yet.
Start "odo dev" first to see binding information.
----

When the resources have been deployed to the cluster, the command also extracts information from the status of the resources to display information about the variables that can be used from the component.

==  Describe without access to Devfile

The `odo describe binding` command extracts information from the cluster if is does not have access to a Devfile.

The command searches for a resource in the current namespace with the given name, the kind `ServiceBinding`, and one of these `apiVersion`:
- `binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1`
- `servicebinding.io/v1alpha3`

If a resource is found, it displays information about the service binding and the variables that can be used from the component.
