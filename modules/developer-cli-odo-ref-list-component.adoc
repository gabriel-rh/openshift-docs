= odo list component

The `odo list component` command provides information about components running in a specific namespace.
If the command is executed from a directory containing a Devfile, it also displays the component
defined in the Devfile as part of the list, prefixed with a star(*).

For each component, the command displays:

- Name.
- Project type.
- Mode it is running which can be `None`, `Dev`, `Deploy`, or both. `None` only applies to the component defined in the local Devfile.
- Application that deployed the component.

[TIP]
====
.Use of cache

`odo list component` makes use of cache for performance reasons. This is the same cache used by `kubectl` when you run the command `kubectl api-resources --cached=true`. As a result, if you install an Operator or CRD on the Kubernetes cluster, and create a resource from it using odo, you might not see it in the `odo list component` output. This would be the case for the 10 minutes time frame for which the cache is considered valid. Beyond this 10 minutes, the cache is updated anyway.

If you want to invalidate the cache before the 10 minutes time frame, you can manually delete it.
====

//  by doing:
// 
// [source,terminal]
// ----
// rm -rf ~/.kube/cache/discovery/api.crc.testing_6443/
// ----
//
//Tee example shows how to invalidate the cache for a CRC cluster. Note that you will have to modify the `api.crc.
// testing_6443` part based on the cluster you are working against.
